    We are immersed in a world of interactive technologies that provide a wealth of information, for better or for worse. In this environment, because we are exposed to so much all the time, it can actually physically alter the way your brain’s neurons function. While neuroplasticity (the pruning of neurons that are less commonly used) can be beneficial because it allows you to keep stronger &amp;more efficient synaptic connections, it has no preference on what is considered an important connection. The atrophy of those connections is widely dependent upon how much they are used. I can hear my neuro professor now, "neurons that fire together, wire together and neurons that fire apart, wire apart." So, what are the repercussions, if any, to allocating certain functions to your brain and others to some sort of technology?

    I’ll start with one of the most obvious and that is a crippled attention span. I personally feel like my neural connections have been tinkered after years of interacting with this universal medium, which most of the information that flows through my eyes and ears and into my mind comes from. While some studies say that the reason we have these technologies is to free up some space for deeper thought processing, I desagree. After studying Human-Computer Interaction in my undergrad, I believe that us humans work on heuristics and that if we assign processes to technologies, it doesn’t necessarily ensure that we will pursue or exercise that space reserved for “deeper thinking." We are faced with a constant stream of stimuli and when there is an absence of that, we get easily distracted, which poses a profound new challenge to focusing and learning.

    In addition to difficulties concentrating, there have also recently been studies on how technologies affect us emotionally. A newly defined term, “FoMo” or fear of missing out, is a social anxiety that stems from the concern that one is missing out on a social interaction. This physiological dependence on a social platform results in a feeling of isolation, which leads to a fear of missing out. Seems pretty cyclical if you ask me. There is also another study that found that the more time a person spends on Facebook, the more their feeling of inadequacy and depression increase.  This effect seems to be cause by feelings of jealousy and even resentment while observing the positive things in someone else’s life. Just remember, Facebook users tend to share only what they <b>want</b> to share in the most extravagant ways!

    I want to revisit neuroplasticity in a social context this time. We already know how technologies affect attention spans and how feelings of indecency arise when interacting with social media, but how does technology affect your neuronal connections which affect your capability to socially interact? <a href="http://www.mirandanet.ac.uk/vl_blog/?page_id=103">Studies</a> show that more time spent behind screens drifts people away from fundamental social skills. I am not talking short-term, although I actually feel a little bit socially awkward after spending days programming (I know I’m not alone here!) But there are actually areas of your brain reserved for things like facial recognition. When there is less social interaction, which is needed to develop these social skills, connections are weakened and are subsequently pruned off. These weakened connections eventually lead to the inability to interpret non-verbal messages. Just think of the next time you’re at a bar, don’t you want to be able to pick up on that eligible bachelor/bachelorette’s cues?? :P

    I think we are all on the right path of learning how to use technology responsibly at Dev Bootcamp (taking breaks, etc). But being able to put my device down is something I need to consciously practice so that I can still hold on to my social neurons, at the very least! Let’s hope to survive the unfavorable technological alterations of the modern mind and responsibly build stronger programming ninja neurons!
