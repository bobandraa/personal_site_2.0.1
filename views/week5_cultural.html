							My pairing experience so far has been encouraging and valuable. In general, I tend to be more of an extrovert so meeting and working with my future cohort felt really natural. I did not anticipate however, that I would face a block that would leave me tongue-tied.
						</p>
						<h3>Wide-eyed &amp; Tongue-tied</h3>
		       	<p class="blog_formatting">
							One difficulty that I did not anticipate became increasingly apparent as I continued pair programming, and that is to be more articulate. I found that when it came to navigating or making specific suggestions, my thoughts dripped out of my mouth as an incoherent string of words. Especially because we are working with a newly acquired language, better articulating my thoughts will help me solidify concepts as well as allow my pair to grasp any suggestions or questions I may have.  Part of this problem seems to stem from feelings of intimidation. There have been times where I feel that the person I am working with has more technical knowledge, which unintentionally constrains my participation. In these cases I hear myself producing fragmented sentences as an internal thought of “this probably isn’t making any sense”, loops in my head.  I realize that most of this is, again, myself getting in the way of my learning (part of my “biggest fear at DBC” email).  It’s times like these that I must remind myself that <b>I</b> putting myself at a disadvantage by not admitting if I don’t understand something.
						</p>
						<p class="blog_formatting">
							Luckily, I have been working with very patient people and always give 100% if I need help with a difficult concept.  Although I recognize that I need to work on being more eloquent during pairing sessions, I usually always walk away with more knowledge and confidence in programming than before. 
						</p>
						<h3>Meta Feedback</h3>
						<p class="blog_formatting">
							My first attempt at submitting Socrates Feedback was a bit tough. How was I supposed to leave actionable, <b>specific</b>, and kind feedback (ASK) while still remaining <b>anonymous</b>? I feel like this element may have generated overly “kind” feedback at times (feedback received and feedback submitted, admittedly).  As the weeks progressed, I noticed the gloves slowly started pealing off and people were leaving feedback peppered with constructive criticism. I honestly felt a lot better when the gloves came off because I felt like people were slowly becoming more comfortable expressing their suggestions and it helped shine a light on an aspect that needed work. There are times where I know I am too hard on myself but reading feedback that talks about the same concerns that I share (ie: better explaining myself) helps me to better assess my perceived short-comings to actual ones like being more articulate while pairing. 
						</p>
						<p class="blog_formatting">
							Overall, the combination of pairing and feedback has made me more aware of tendencies I hope to scrap and characteristics that I count on building while at DBC and beyond.
